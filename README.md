Jcray Modules v8
===============

(Working on.)

These modules are used on [Jcray](http://jcray.com).

## Why modules ?
This repository is made to show modules source code used on jcray (v8). Jcray v8 modules system can use dynamic source (for example, modules developed by users) or static source files (for example, modules developed by administrators)

## Issues & fixes
Users can submit issues directly in this repository, or submit their fixes using pull requests.

## Tests
Tests are [behat](http://behat.org/en/latest/guides.html) tests and can only be launched in jcray v8 environnement (not in your environnement).


## Deploy && runing tests
Coming soon.
( idea: a jcray v8 dev version, on which everybody can run custom modules from custom branch)
